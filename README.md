# Toolhouse Final Project

This project leverages data analysis and machine learning techniques to build a Random Forest Classifier. The goal of the project is to analyze data, train a machine learning model, and evaluate its performance using various metrics such as **accuracy** and **ROC AUC score**.

## Project Structure

- **Data Analysis**: 
  - Uses `Pandas` and `NumPy` for data manipulation.
  - Visualizes data using `Seaborn` and `Matplotlib`.

- **Machine Learning**:
  - Uses `RandomForestClassifier` from `scikit-learn` for classification tasks.
  - Evaluates model performance using `accuracy_score` and `roc_auc_score`.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

**Clone the repository**, if applicable:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

**Run the Python Notebook!**
